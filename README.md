* [Field Map](https://github.com/chiahrens/fll/blob/master/fieldWithGrid.png) - I used to actually sync the grid marks with the distance travelled per tire rotation, but that was just doing too much work for them. I like to let them figure it out themselves as a team. It seems like a more practical team building exercise than lowering the yard stick.

* [Cheat Sheet](https://github.com/chiahrens/fll/blob/master/cheetSheet.png) - Cheat sheet with basic EV3 blocks that they can use to design their program using the [Flow Chart](https://github.com/chiahrens/fll/blob/master/flow.png)

* [Flow Chart](https://github.com/chiahrens/fll/blob/master/flow.png) - Flow chart to actually design the program before actually programming it into Mindstorms. Kids are expected to use some math to get the program as close to complete as possible before they actually load it into the EV3 and test the real run. They are expected to update this with the final program in Mindstorms so that we can keep a record and show this to the judges for robot design.


I create a design packet per mission set, which may be 1 or many missions in a single run. Each pair takes a mission set. The design packet stays with the mission set. After a couple of weeks, they have a handoff meeting, and they rotate missions, even if they aren't finished with the mission. If one of the teams completes a mission set, they start on a new mission set. They need to continue to collaborate with all the team members on the attachment design as well as the program as they progress. This ensures that every member of the team can:
* run every mission
* debug every mission
* know where every mission starts
* know the attachments of every mission and how to attach and detach it from the robot

After a complete rotation, I mix up the pairs.
