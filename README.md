* [Field Map](https://github.com/chiahrens/fll/blob/master/fieldWithGrid.png) - I used to actually sync the grid marks with the distance travelled per tire rotation, but that was just doing too much work for them. I like to let them figure it out themselves as a team. It seems like a more practical team building exercise than lowering the yard stick.

* [Cheat Sheet](https://github.com/chiahrens/fll/blob/master/cheetSheet.png) - Cheat sheet with basic EV3 blocks that they can use to design their program using the [Flow Chart](https://github.com/chiahrens/fll/blob/master/flow.png)

* [Flow Chart](https://github.com/chiahrens/fll/blob/master/flow.png) - Flow chart to actually design the program before actually programming it into Mindstorms. Kids are expected to use some math to get the program as close to complete as possible before they actually load it into the EV3 and test the real run. They are expected to update this with the final program in Mindstorms so that we can keep a record and show this to the judges for robot design.
